<h4>Machine Learning #1 Classification [iris_dataset](https://github.com/Modiodal/ML/blob/master/iris_dataset.py)</h4>

The data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). This is a simple supervised learning visualizaion and data analysis program. This is the first of many Machine Learning programs I plan on building the coming months.
