# Machine Learning Programs

## #1 - Classification [iris_dataset](../master/iris_dataset.py)

The data is from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository which can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). This is a simple supervised learning visualizaion and data analysis program. This is the first of many Machine Learning programs I plan on building in the coming months. 

## #2 - Regression [binance_regression](../master/binance_regression.py)

This data was taken from Binance's api which can accessed [here](https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/binance.html). For this program I set out to learn about regression and its impact on predicting future stock. During my time completing this program, I realized I should learn object oriented programming and implement that into my code. It was my fascination with cryptocurrencies volatility that drew me away from the traditional stock market.
