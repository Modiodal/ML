# Machine Learning Programs

## #1 Machine Learning - Classification [iris_dataset](../master/iris_dataset.py)

The data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). This is a simple supervised learning visualizaion and data analysis program. This is the first of many Machine Learning programs I plan on building the coming months.
